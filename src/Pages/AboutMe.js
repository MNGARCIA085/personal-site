      I was born in Montevideo, but my childhood and adolescence unfolded in Carmelo. 
      I returned to Montevideo to continue my studies and explore my growing interest in 
      the world of technology.

        When I'm not working, I enjoy sports; currently, I engage in cycling and swimming. These activities not 
        only keep my mind fresh but also fuel my determination and discipline.

        <br></br> <br/>

        I love sitcoms and anime. The laughter from comedies and the originality of anime provide 
        a welcome escape, balancing my technical life with a touch of fun and creativity.

        <br></br> <br/>

        My journey, blending technical expertise with life experiences, defines me 
        as a committed and passionate professional.
