            For the final project, the task was to use the Foursquare API and solve a problem of our choice for 
            the country Canada. <br></br>
            As I have always been a fan of sports and even worked at my father's gym since I was a child, I decided 
            to ask myself: if I were to open a gym 
            in Canada, where would be the best place to do it?
